## Base Model Results

As a supplement to the model results figures included in this report and described below, a full set of [diagnostic plots](https://github.com/mcgoodman/widow-assessment-update/tree/main/figures/2025%20base%20model%20r4ss%20plots) created by the r4ss package (@taylor_2021_r4ss) is available on the assessment GitHub repository ([github.com/mcgoodman/widow-assessment-update](https://github.com/mcgoodman/widow-assessment-update/)) along with the Stock Synthesis [input files](https://github.com/mcgoodman/widow-assessment-update/tree/main/models/2025%20base%20model).

### Parameter Estimates

The base model parameter estimates along with approximate asymptotic standard errors are shown in @tbl-params and the likelihood components are shown in @tbl-likecomps. Estimates of key derived parameters and approximate 95% asymptotic confidence intervals are shown in @tbl-key-deriv-params.

The estimates of natural mortality (`r est_params["NatM_uniform_Fem_GP_1","Value"]` yr^-1^  and `r est_params["NatM_uniform_Mal_GP_1","Value"]` yr^-1^ for females and males, respectively) were higher than suggested by the medians of the prior distributions used in this assessment and the 2015 assessment. Fixing M at lower values than those estimates resulted in a pattern of reduced recruitment immediately before the fishery started. This suggests that the model is attempting to reduce the number of observations of older fish in the data. The estimates of M fall within the 95% confidence interval of the prior distribution (`r round(natm_prior_ci["lo"],3)`– `r round(natm_prior_ci["hi"],3)`), and are shown in @fig-NatMort-priors. This is a decrease from the 2015 benchmark assessment (Female: 0.1572, Male: 0.1705; @hicks_status_2015) and the 2019 update asssessment (Female  0.1444, Male: 0.1549; @adams_status_2019)

Estimating M is difficult in stock assessments, and the estimated values may represent model misspecification instead of the actual life-history trait. However, in alternative models to the base, the estimates of M were rarely higher than 0.14 yr^-1^ (@tbl-quant-sens-int). Uncertainty in the estimated M was also much less than the range of the prior (@fig-NatMort-priors). The assumption that appeared to have the largest effect on M was introducing dome-shaped selectivity in the midwater trawl fleet, which made M smaller (@tbl-quant-sens-int). 

Selectivity curves were estimated for commercial and survey fleets and parameter estimates are provided in @tbl-params. The estimated selectivity, retention, and keep (the product of selectivity and retention) curves for the trawl and hook-and-line fleets are shown in @fig-est-select-all. The selectivity curves showed a shift to larger fish in 2002 for the bottom trawl fishery, a shift to smaller fish in 2003 for the hook-and-line fishery, and a strong dome-shaped selectivity for the midwater fleet. The bottom trawl shift is consistent with the introduction of the Rockfish Conservation Area (RCA) and gear restrictions (shoreward of the 18 RCA) that virtually eliminated fishing in shelf habitats where smaller widow rockfish would more likely be encountered. Around this same time, the fixed-gear RCA specifications began preventing fishing between 30 and 100 m. The strong dome-shape of the midwater fleet suggests a lack of observations of older females, and, to some extent, older males as well. Due to it consistently approaching the lower bound when estimated, the decision was made to fix the log-ascending width of the hook-and-line fleet selectivity curve at -5.

The retention curves (@fig-ret-tv) showed a shift to retaining a lower percentage of fish since trip limits were introduced. The asymptote of the retention curve for the bottom trawl fishery sequentially decreased as more management restrictions were introduced to about 50% retention of larger fish in the 1998-2010 period. In recent years, bottom trawl retention is estimated at approximately 99%.

Midwater trawl and hook-and-line fisheries estimated an asymptote to retention just above 80% for the period 1983-2010. Both the selectivity for the hake fleet and the selectivity of the net fleet did not support dome-shaped selectivity (@fig-est-select-all). The estimated selectivity curves for the Triennial and WCGBTS were similar to each other except that the triennial survey selected larger fish (@fig-est-select-3478). The WCGBTS exhibited a more pronounced dome-shaped selectivity compared to the 2015 assessment. 

In  the 2015 assessment, additional survey variability (process error added directly to each year’s input variability) for the triennial and WCGBTS was not estimated in the model because the estimate was zero [@hicks_status_2015]. To avoid bound issues in estimation of the Hessian, the authors fixed these at zero because the model results included reasonable estimates of variance. We retained the same modelling approach for the update assessment. The additional standard deviation added to the fishery-dependent indices was quite large, ranging from `r round(est_params["Q_extraSD_BottomTrawl(1)","Value"],2)` for the bottom trawl index and `r round(est_params["Q_extraSD_ForeignAtSea(9)","Value"],2)` for the foreign at-sea hake fleet. The additional variability on the juvenile survey was the highest, at `r round(est_params["Q_extraSD_JuvSurvey(6)","Value"],2)`, giving the index very little weight in the model. 

The estimates of maximum size for both females and males (@tbl-params) did not differ substantially from @adams_status_2019. Estimates of k were slightly different in the model, but that is expected when accounting for selectivity. Estimated growth curves are shown in (@fig-sizeatage-sdcv). 

Estimates of recruitment suggest that the widow rockfish population is characterized by variable recruitment with occasional strong recruitment events and periods of low recruitment (@fig-recdev-est, @tbl-key-deriv-params). There is little information regarding recruitment prior to 1965.

THIS IS REPEATED ELSEWHERE
, and the uncertainty in these estimates is expressed in the model. There are very large, but uncertain, estimates of recruitment in 2013, 1970, 2008, and 1971. Other large recruitment events (in descending order of magnitude) occurred in 1978, 2014, 1981, 2010, and 1991. The five lowest recruitments (in ascending order) occurred in 2012, 2011, 1976, 2007, and 1973. Two of the four largest estimated recruitments occurred in the last 11 years. -->


### Fits to the Data

Fits to data are discussed for survey abundance indices, discard data (biomass and length compositions), length composition data for the fisheries and surveys, marginal age compositions for the fisheries, and conditional age-at-length observations for the WCGBTS. 

Survey indices and total discards were fitted assuming a lognormal likelihood. The five indices of abundance (three survey series, and two fishery indices of abundance) are shown in @fig-surv-abundest. The Triennial Shelf Survey treatment was consistent with [@adams_status_2019]. Extra standard error was estimated for all of the series except for the two survey series (@tbl-params). None of the series showed patterns in residuals, and with the large amount of error, none of the series showed serious lack of fit. The recent WCGBTS showed a general increase from 2003 - 2015 followed by a general decrease from 2016 - 2024, which was also estimated in the base model (@fig-surv-abundest). The model did not fit the indices variability well, particularly years with relatively low (2015, 2021, 2022) or high (2016) estimates of abundance.

The 2019 model applied four time blocks to midwater trawl retention, with constant fixed discard rates of 1% in both early years (1916-1981) and late years (2011 onward). With the addition of new discard data since the 2017 reallocation, the use of a fixed discard rate from 2011 onward resulted in poor fits to the discard data. Therefore the current assessment utilizes an additional block on retention from 2011-2016, with the final block beginning in 2017; retention is estimated in both the 2011-2016 and 2017-2024 time blocks, though it remains fixed for the earliest time block (1916-1981) at the value used in the previous assessment. The first time block with discard data was 1983 to 2001. Predicted discards for all three years of the Pikitch data (1985–1987) were underfit, but within the confidence limits (@fig-pred-obs-discards). EDCP data in 1997 and 1998 were underfit. The second time block was from 2002-2010, which contained only one observation in 2002 (and was fit exactly, as expected). Discard rates were overestimated in 2012-2013 and underestimated in 2015-2016, though they were generally well fit in in the 2017-2024 time blocks.

Fits to the length-composition data are displayed in two different ways: the Pearson residuals-at-length are shown for each year for all types of length compositions, and also compared across fleets. More detailed plots of fitted lines drawn over the plotted proportions at length are shown in Appendix A. Pearson residuals for the fisheries (@fig-lenage-pears-res-trawl, @fig-lenage-pears-res-hklnet) do not show consistent patterns, but they do show that some fleets are not fitting some cohorts. Each fleet also shows that there are periods where older fish are underfit, and periods when older fish are overfit. With a peaked length frequency distribution, it is common for these patterns to appear given shifts in the expected distribution due to sampling error, and time-varying parameters that are assumed time-invariant. The net fishery observed some very large fish in the first two years of data, but did not observe those fish in later years. This pattern was not seen in any other fishery. There were also years where females showed positive residuals (filled circle, observed > expected) and males showed negative residuals (e.g., @fig-lenage-pears-res-trawl, early years of bottom trawl and midwater trawl). It is uncertain if this pattern is related to growth, sexing error, or to sex-specific selectivity (e.g., when widow rockfish aggregate, sexes possibly may be aggregating separately). Overall, the fits to commercial fishery length compositions showed some patterns that the 2015 assessment deemed to require complicated modelling assumptions to alleviate. However, the residuals were mostly less than 2 in absolute value, especially for fleets that were well informed by data. The model fits the marginal length composition integrated among years for each fleet well (@fig-comp-lenfit-aggreg). 

The fits to bottom trawl discard length frequencies were generally good except in the years since trawl rationalisation began (2011). These recent years observed small fish, which the estimated selectivity of the trawl fleet did not allow for. There were no other years that showed small fish being caught by the trawl fleet. Attempting to explain these small fish with additional time blocks on selectivity and retention did not help because explaining the small fish in the discards worsened the fits to the landed and larger fish. Discards are extremely small in this time period, so it is unlikely that a misfit here will have a lot of effect on the model. Combining the discard length frequencies over years may not be appropriate for the bottom trawl fishery due to the likely changes in discarding practices, but @fig-lenage-pears-res-trawl shows the prediction of discarding smaller females than observed and a more peaked observed distribution of discarded males than predicted. 

The Triennial Shelf and WCGBTS surveys length frequencies showed underfitting of older fish in some years and underfitting of younger fish in others (@fig-comp-lenfit-trien). The combined length frequencies across years were bimodal with a valley around 37 cm, and the model showed an indication of a bimodal distribution but was unable to adequately capture both peaks (@fig-comp-lenfit-aggreg). The nonparametric selectivity pattern helped to reduce this pattern, but selectivity may be even more complicated for the surveys. 

Age data were fitted as marginal age compositions for the fishing fleets and as conditional age-at-length for the WCGBTS, which were expanded by tow and then by strata. Expanded age-at-length data were used, following the 2015 benchmark assessment (@hicks_status_2015). Pearson residuals for the commercial fleets are shown in @fig-lenage-pears-res-trawl and @fig-lenage-pears-res-hklnet. For the trawl fisheries in @fig-lenage-pears-res-trawl, there are diagonal patterns that mostly correspond to cohorts ageing through the years. However, there are instances where the diagonal seems to shift, such as the filled circles of the midwater trawl fishery on the lower left of the plot (years 1981–1991). The patterns match the length compositions residuals in some cases. The bottom trawl fishery shows the largest residuals in the most recent years, which could indicate a change in selectivity. The net and hook-and- line fits to age compositions (@fig-lenage-pears-res-hklnet) showed larger residuals than the trawl fisheries. As with the fits to the length compositions, the net fishery showed the inability to match the large number of older fish observed in the early years. There appears to be a strong shift in residuals in 1988 when a lack of fit to potentially a cohort appears. The residuals were typically less than 2 for fits to the age data. However, the female age compositions occasionally produced some large residuals that were not consistently seen in the male age compositions. Aggregating across years shows that the fit to age comps was good for the trawl fleets and less so for the net and hook-and-line fleets, which had smaller sample sizes (@fig-combine-agefreq-all). The aggregated data also showed that the predictions were often unable to fit the peak in the data.

The observed and expected age-at-length are shown in @fig-condAAL-andreplot for the twelve years of the WCGBTS observations. The fits generally match the observations with some misfit at larger lengths. The standard deviation of age-at-length was variable and often the expectation was higher than the observations at larger lengths. Plots with the residuals for individual observations showed reasonably good fits to the conditional age-at-length data from the NWFSC shelf/combo survey (@fig-condAAL-resids). Some outliers are apparent, with large residuals mostly at smaller lengths for a given age.


### Population Trajectory

The predicted spawning biomass (in metric tons) is given in @tbl-ts-popests-basecase and plotted in @fig-spawnout-95. The predicted spawning biomass from the base model generally showed a slight decline over the time series until 1966 when the foreign fleet began. A short, but sharp decline occurred, followed by a steep increase due to strong recruitment. The spawning biomass declined rapidly with the developing domestic midwater fishery in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The stock continued to decline until 2000 when a combination of strong recruitment and low catches resulted in a quick increase from 2000 - 2018. The stock declined rapidly from 2019 until the end of the time series, due to a combination of increased catches and low recruitment. 

The 2025 spawning biomass relative to unfished equilibrium spawning biomass is above the target of 40% of unfinished spawning biomass (`r Bratio$Value[Bratio$Year == 2025]`%), with a low of `r min(Bratio$Value, na.rm = TRUE)`% in `r Bratio$Year[which.min(Bratio$Value)]` (@fig-rel-spawn-bio). This suggests that widow rockfish was not overfished, as was inferred from previous assessments (Williams et al. 2000). Approximate confidence intervals based on the asymptotic variance estimates show that the uncertainty in the estimated spawning biomass is high, especially in the early years. It should be noted that while the stock is currently above the 40% target, the target does fall within the approximate 95% confidence interval (@fig-rel-spawn-bio).

Recruitment deviations (@fig-recdev-est and discussed in Section 3.3.1) provide a more realistic portrayal of uncertainty. There are very large, but uncertain, estimates of recruitment in 1970, 2008, 2016, and 1971 (in descending order of magnitude). Other large recruitment events (in descending order of magnitude) occurred in 1978, 1981, 2010, and 1991. The five lowest recruitments (in ascending order) occurred in 2012, 2019, 2020, 2011, and 1976. The 2008 and 2016 year classes were estimated as 2 of the 4 strongest year classes. The 2019 update assessment estimated the 2013 recruitment as the strongest year class over the duration of the fishery, however the current assessment does not support this.  It may be worthwhile to investigate the periods of strong and weak year classes further to see if it is an artifact of the data, a consistent autocorrelation, or a result of the environment. The input bias adjustment ramp matched the estimated (@fig-recfit-bias).

The stock-recruit curve resulting from a fixed value of steepness is shown in @fig-recfit-bias with estimated recruitments also shown. The stock is predicted to have never fallen to low enough levels that the steepness is obvious. However, the lowest levels of predicted spawning biomass showed some of the smallest recruitments and very few above average recruitments. Steepness was not estimated in this model, but sensitivities to alternative values of steepness are discussed below.
