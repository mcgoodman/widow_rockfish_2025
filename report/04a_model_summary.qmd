## Model Structure and Assumptions

### Model Changes from the Last Assessment

The assessment followed the same model structure as the 2015 benchmark assessment [@hicks_status_2015] and 2019 update assessment [@adams_status_2019]. The changes made to the previous assessment model include:

- **Adding most recent data from commercial fleets** (as described in "Data" section of this report).
- **Updating \gls{s-wcgbt} index using current methodology** (as described in "Data" section of this report).
- **Updating the prior for natural mortality** based on @hamel_development_2022.
- **Updating length-weight parameters estimated** by including most recent data.
- **Extending the main period for estimating recruitment deviations and updating recruitment bias adjustment parameters** based on @methot_adjusting_2011.
- **Adding a block to the retention curve for the midwater trawl fleet and a block to hake fleet selectivity to account for recent changes in fleet behavior.** Adding a block to the retention curve for midwater trawl allowed for recent increases in midwater trawl discards (from 2017 forward), and improved fit to discard amounts modeled in the assessment. Adding a block to hake fleet selectivity accounted for a change in fish mean length (2020--2024) due to shifts in the spatial distribution of the hake fleet and to improve fit to length compositions [@holland_bycatch_2019]. Neither change had a discernible influence on the estimated SSB. See the "Model Bridging" section for additional detail.
- **Adding hook-and-line discards to landings in the hook-and-line fleet.** WCGOP corrected discard lengths for the hook-and-line fleet to omit nearshore fixed gear samples, which were erroneously included with the hook-and-line fleet in the previous benchmark [@hicks_status_2015] and update assessments [@adams_status_2019]. This resulted in changes to the discard length distribution and years for which data was available [@fig-disc-hnl-comparison]. Because of decreased sample sizes of hook-and-line discard length data available, this update assessment model was unable to reliably estimate retention parameters and exhibited substantial sensitivity to even slight changes in discard amounts within the hook-and-line fleet. Therefore, in this assessment, we added the hook-and-line discard to hook-and-line landings. Correction of the hook-and-line discard lengths translated into lower estimated recruitment in the 2010s than that of in 2019 update assessment (higher recruitment estimates in the 2019 assessment were previously informed by erroneous estimates of smaller fish, which were corrected in this assessment by combining the hock-and-line discards and landings). Lower recruitment in turn contributed to a decrease in stock size in recent years.

Comparison of \gls{ssb} and fraction unfished between 2019 update assemsent model and this 2025 model are shown in @fig-base_19_25_ssb to @fig-base_19_25_recdevs. See "Model Bridging" section for further details.

#### Model Bridging

The exploration of models began by bridging from the 2019 update assessment to SS3 version 3.30.2, which produced no discernible difference. We then focused on data bridging (@fig-bridge2019-data). Updating the catch series did not have a substantial effect on the historical biomass; the stock biomass increasing from 2000--2020 before decreasing up to the current period. 

Updating the model discards had the most significant impact on the absolute stock biomass (SSB): absolute SSB before 1980 was slightly lower than the 2019 update assessment estimates, and noticeably lower from the mid 2010s through the current year. Updates to model indices and composition data, following updates to discards, lead to minor changes in SSB estimates. Updates to discards had the largest effect on relative SSB (fraction of unfished biomass); updates to all other data sets, following updates to discards, lead to minor changes in relative SSB estimates (@fig-bridge2019-bratio). 

The model bridging changes included (1) updating the prior for natural mortality (M) to follow that recommended by @hamel_development_2022, (2) updating fixed parameters of the male and female length-weight curve by fitting to data from the \gls{s-wcgbt}, ASHOP, and the \gls{s-tri} outside the model, (3) re-fitting the bias adjustment ramp for recruitment deviates, (4) adding a block on retention in the midwater trawl fishery from 2011--2016 and allowing estimation of retention in the final years of the model, which was previously fixed at 0.99, (5) adding a block to hake fleet selectivity from 2020--2024 (5) re-fitting the model using the MLE as initial values following a jittering analysis, which revealed the previous MLE was a local minima. These changes collectively resulted in a very small decrease in relative SSB post-1990, and pairwise correlations among all shared parameters in these models were high (>0.999). Bridging from the previous prior on M to the @hamel_development_2022 prior is detailed in the “Priors” section. None of these model bridging steps had a substantial effect on the estimates of stock biomass (@fig-bridge2019-data). 

To estimate discards in the model, time blocks for changes in selectivity and retention in discard data were used. Except for the aforementioned addition of blocks to the midwater trawl and hake fleets, the same structure for time blocks was used as in the most recent update assessment [@adams_status_2019]. The addition of midwater trawl and hake fleets block was necessitated by poor fits to midwater trawl discards and the length composition data from the hake fleet in from 2020--2024, respectively. The poor fit to hake fleet length composition data may be due to the high variability in the distribution of the hake fleet between years, as the fleet moves to avoid bycatch [@holland_bycatch_2019]. Poor fit to midwater trawl discards is thought to be due to (1) the previous decision to fix late-year retention to 0.99 which represented an overestimate of the (very low) discards in 2011--2016, and (2) the reallocation of quota shares and subsequent increase in midwater trawl discards in 2017. These choices are described in more detail in the “Fits to Data” section.

### Modeling Platform and Structure

For this update assessment, new versions of the previously used software were used. The 2019 update assessment used Stock Synthesis v3.30.13 to estimate the model; and R4SS version 1.35.3 and R version 3.5.3 to investigate and plot the 2019 model fits. This update used Stock Synthesis v3.30.2 to estimate the model; and R4SS version 1.52.0 and R version 4.5.0 to investigate and plot the model fits. A summary of the data sources used in the model (details discussed above) is shown in @fig-data-plot-base. 

### Model Overview

The model is a two-sex, age-structured model starting in 1916 with an accumulated age group at 40 years. Sex-specific growth and natural mortality were estimated. The lengths in the population were tracked by 1 cm intervals and the length data were binned into 2 cm intervals. Ageing error was retained from the 2015 benchmark assessment [@hicks_status_2015]. Fecundity was assumed to be proportional to body weight, thus \gls{ssb} was used as the measure of spawning output.

#### Model Fleets and Areas

The assessment uses a single-area model, consistent with previous benchmark and update assessments [@hicks_status_2015, @adams_status_2019]. Multiple fisheries encounter widow rockfish. The definitions of fishing fleets have not been changed from previous benchmark and update assessments [@hicks_status_2015, @adams_status_2019].

### Model Parameters 

#### Estimated and Fixed Parameters

There were 214 estimated parameters in the base model. These included one parameter for recruitment (R0), 10 sex-specific parameters for sex-specific growth, two sex-specific natural mortality parameters, four parameters for the catchability (q) of the hake and the \gls{s-tri} of abundance (catchability for other indices were calculated analytically using the "float" option in SS3), four parameters each for extra variability for the hake, bottom trawl, juvenile and foreign-at-sea indices of abundance, 49 parameters for selectivity, retention, and time blocking of the fleets, eight parameters for survey selectivity, 125 recruitment deviations, and 12 forecast recruitment deviations.

Fixed parameters in the model included steepness, standard deviation of recruitment deviates, maturity at age, and length-weight parameters Consistent with the previous full assessment [@adams_status_2019], steepness was fixed at 0.72, matching the mean of the current west coast rockfish steepness prior [@thorson_steep_2019], described below in the "Priors" section. A likelihood profile were done for steepness. The standard deviation of recruitment deviates was fixed at 0.60. Maturity at age was fixed as described in the previous update assessment, @adams_status_2019. Length-weight parameters were fixed at estimates using length-weight observations from the \gls{s-wcgbt} (@fig-wl-fits and @tbl-params).

All selectivity curves in the final base model were length based and the same shape as the 2019 update, with the exception of the \gls{s-wcgbt} survey fleet. The final base model assumed asymptotic selectivity (using the double-normal formulation in SS3) for each fishery, except for the midwater trawl fishery, following the 2015 benchmark assessment [@hicks_status_2015]. The \gls{s-wcgbt} and \gls{s-tri} both used spline curves. The \gls{s-wcgbt} survey fleet selectivity was estimated to be slightly lower at lengths greater than 45 cm, compared to the selectivity estimated in 2019.

Time blocks were used for selectivity and retention parameters in the bottom trawl, midwater trawl, hake and hook-and-line fisheries as indicated in @tbl-speci-base-assess.

#### Priors

The prior on natural mortality (M) in the previous assessment was defined as a lognormal with mean on the log-scale of ln(5.4/Amax) and SD(ln(M)) = 0.44 following analysis of the data in @then_evaluating_2015 by Owen Hamel and the authors. In the current assessment the prior on M has been updated to reflect guidance from @hamel_development_2022; the log-mean therefore remains unchanged while the log-SD has been set to 0.31. Using a maximum age of 54 the point estimate and median of the prior on M is 0.10.

The prior for steepness (h) assumes a beta distribution with parameters based on an update of the Dorn rockfish prior (commonly used in past West Coast rockfish assessments) conducted by Jim Thorson (pers. comm, NWFSC, NOAA), which was reviewed and endorsed by the SSC in 2015. During the stock assessment review in 2015, it was decided that the steepness prior should be developed without the past widow rockfish data to avoid using the same data to inform both the model prior and likelihood. Without widow rockfish, the prior used for the 2015 assessment was a beta distribution with mean = 0.798 and SD = 0.132 (corresponding beta parameters $\alpha$ = 6.59 and $\beta$ = 1.667). The 2019 update assessments used the current West Coast rockfish steepness prior with mean = 0.72 and SD = 0.16 ($\alpha$ = 4.95, $\beta$ = 1.93) which was approved for use in all rockfish stock assessments for 2019. This update assessment uses the same prior as the 2019 update assessment [@adams_status_2019]. 

#### Recruitment deviations

Recruitment deviations from 1900--2024 were estimated to appropriately quantify uncertainty; inappropriate specifications can have a large effect on model uncertainty. The standard deviation of recruitment variability (sigma-R) was assumed to be 0.6 in the 2015 assessment, based on iteratively tuning to a value slightly less than the observed variability of recruitment deviations in the period 1975--2010 in 2015 (@fig-recfit-bias). The earliest length-composition data occur in 1976 and the earliest age data were in 1978. The most informed years for estimating recruitment deviations based on available composition data were from about the mid-1970s to about 2019. The period from 1900--1970 was fit using an early series with little or no bias adjustment, the main period of recruitment deviates was 1971--2020 using a bias adjustment ramp, and 2021 onward was fit using forecast recruitment deviates with little bias adjustment. @methot_adjusting_2011 summarize the reasoning behind varying levels of bias adjustment based on the information available to estimate the deviates.

####  Sample weights

Because the most recent benchmark assessment used the McAllister & Ianelli method [@hicks_status_2015] and changing the weighting method is outside the TOR for an update, this assessment uses McAllister & Ianelli method. The Francis weighting method is presented as a sensitivity.

In the current assessment, the weighting method the composition datasets in SS3 was to use variance adjustment factors as the weighting factors. The fleet and data-type (length or age) factor was entered as variance adjustments factors until the harmonic mean of the effective sample sizes matched the mean of the adjusted input sample sizes [@mcallister_bayesian_1997]. Once the weighting was determined, lambda factors for all fleets with both marginal length and marginal age compositions were down-weighted by 0.5 to account for the potential double use of data since length and age are observed from the same fish. This differs from McAllister & Ianelli weighting method the 2019 update assessment, which weighted composition data via the lambdas [@adams_status_2019].
