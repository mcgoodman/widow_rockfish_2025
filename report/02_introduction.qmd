# Introduction

This is an assessment of widow rockfish that inhabit the waters off California, Oregon, and Washington from the U.S.-Canadian border in the north to the U.S.-Mexico border in the south, and does not include Puget Sound.

*Sebastes entomelas* (widow rockfish) is named after its black-lined gut cavity (*ento* meaning within and *melas* meaning black). It has been referred to as buda, beccafico (Italian bird), and viuva (widow) prior to the 1930s. More recently, the widow rockfish is also called brownie, belinda bass, brown bomber, and soft brown.

## Distribution and Stock Structure

Widow rockfish inhabit water depths of 25â€“370 m from northern Baja California, Mexico to Southeastern Alaska, and are most abundant from British Columbia to Northern California. Although catches north of the U.S.-Canada border or south of the U.S.-Mexico border were not included in this assessment, it is possible that these populations contribute to the biomass of widow rockfish off of the U.S. West Coast through adult migration and/or larval dispersion.

This assessment is based on a single coastwide area model. There is little evidence of genetically separate stocks along the U.S. coast and past assessments have used a single area versus a two-area assessment model and results were found to be similar [@he_status_2011]. There is some evidence of biological differences between areas. For example, widow rockfish collected off California tend to mature at a smaller length than widow rockfish collected off of Oregon [@barss_maturity_1987]. This may be due to environmental or anthropogenic effects rather than genetic differences.

## Management performance

Total mortality estimates from the \gls{wcgop} and from the stock assessment may differ due to the use of different methods. Investigation into how these methods differ is beyond the scope of an update assessment. @tbl-manage-guide shows that recent landings have been below recommended catch levels. Landings are a considerable amount below the ACL, and it is unlikely that total mortality has exceeded the \gls{acl} in the last 10 years.
